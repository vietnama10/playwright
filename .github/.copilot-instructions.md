# Global Testing Instructions (Playwright Project)

Copilot, when generating Playwright test code, always follow these rules:

## 1. General
- Always use Playwright Test (test, expect).
- Always use Page Object Model pattern.
- Always import existing POM class files inside /playwright/pages.
- Always use async/await.
- All tests must be independent.
- Use meaningful test names based on the test scenario.

## 2. Page Objects
- All page classes are already defined under "playwright/pages/".
- Each method in a POM has a detailed JSDoc description of the action it performs.
- Always call POM methods instead of using page.locator directly.
- Do not redefine elements or actions that already exist in the POM.

## 3. Test Data
- Test cases are stored in CSV or Excel format under "test-data/".
- The first column "testCase" is the scenario key.
- Use the CSV row to drive the input values for the test.
- Map CSV values correctly to POM methods.

## 4. Test Structure
Each test should follow this pattern:

1. Load CSV test data.
2. For each row, run a test using test.describe().
3. Instantiate the POM.
4. Perform actions using POM methods.
5. Assert expectedResult using expect() and POM validation methods.

## 5. Output Format
- All generated test code must be placed inside files under "tests/*.spec.ts".
- Tests must be generated only inside the spec file the user is editing.
- Do not create new files or modify files outside the current spec file.
- Ensure proper imports at the top of the spec file.
